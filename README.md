# BrainTumorSegmentation-PYTHON

Computer vision has played an important role in medical imaging.

The current application was designed to perform image processing technqiues to segment out the tumor from 2D MRI images.
It would help doctor to learn the details about tumor in preopeartive surgery phase.

Following application is a python-based GUI-interface.The GUI is designed using <b>Pyqt5</b>,while on the backend <b>OpenCV</b> was used to perform
image processing functionalites.

The image processing techniques performed in a sequence as followed<br/>
<br/>
<b>1.Select the image desired to perform segmentation <br/></b>
<b>2.Apply bilateral filter<br/></b>
<b>3.Apply median filter<br/></b>
<b>4.Apply gaussian filter<br/></b>
<b>5.Peform thresholding<br/></b>
<b>6.Dilation<br/></b>
<b>7.Perform morphological operations.<br/></b>
<b>8.Add color map<br/></b>
<b>9.Save the segmented image<br/></b>
